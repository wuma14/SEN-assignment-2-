SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)

Project: Student Result Management System (SRMS)

1️⃣ Requirement Analysis

This stage identifies what the software should achieve.

Functional Requirements

The system should:

Allow users to add student details (name and matric number)

Allow users to enter student scores

Automatically calculate student grades

Display all stored student results

Provide a menu-driven interface

Non-Functional Requirements

The system should be easy to use

Results should be accurate

The program should respond quickly

The system should run on any computer with Python installed

2️⃣ System Design

This stage defines how the system will be built.

Design Decisions

Programming Language: Python

Interface Type: Command Line Interface (CLI)

Data Storage: Dictionary data structure

Architecture: Procedural programming approach

System Modules

Student Registration Module

Score Entry Module

Grade Calculation Module

Result Display Module

Menu Control Module

3️⃣ Implementation

This stage involves converting the design into actual code.

Implementation Details

A dictionary (students) stores student records

Functions are created for each task:

add_student() – registers students

add_score() – records scores

calculate_grade() – determines grades

view_results() – displays student data

menu() – controls user interaction

Conditional statements are used for grade calculation

Loops allow continuous program execution until exit

The full implementation is written in Python and saved as
student_result_system.py.

4️⃣ Testing

This stage ensures the system works correctly.

Testing Performed

Unit Testing: Each function was tested independently

Input Validation Testing: Checked valid and invalid inputs

Boundary Testing: Tested scores like 0, 45, 70, and 100

Errors discovered during testing were corrected to ensure accurate output.

5️⃣ Deployment

This stage involves making the software available for use.

Deployment Process

The program is run locally using a Python interpreter

The source code is uploaded to GitHub

The repository allows version control and easy access

6️⃣ Maintenance

This stage handles future updates and improvements.

Maintenance Activities

Fixing bugs if discovered

Improving the grading logic

Adding features such as:

Database storage

Graphical User Interface (GUI)

User authentication

 Conclusion

The Student Result Management System was developed following all stages of the SDLC.
Applying SDLC ensured the software was well-structured, reliable, and maintainable.
Graphical User Interface (GUI)

User authentication
